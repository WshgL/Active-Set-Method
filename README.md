# Active Set Method for Constrained Least Squares

A C++ implementation of the Active Set Method for solving constrained least squares problems, based on:

- **Härkegård, O.** "Efficient active set algorithms for solving constrained least squares problems in aircraft control allocation," *Proceedings of the 41st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 2002*.
- **Smeur, E., Höppener, D., De Wagter, C.** "Prioritized control allocation for quadrotors subject to saturation," *International Micro Air Vehicle Conference and Flight Competition*, 2017.

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
